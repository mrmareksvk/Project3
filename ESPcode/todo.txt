MQTT:
     if something is crashing rework ping time in pubsub library

     make server connection in constructor

     MQTT topic for every sensor
     baaa/sensor???/vars (sens999 max)  (19+1(delim) chars)
     vars = {temp,hum,lux,lat,lon,date,time}

     MAYBE
     - move mqtt server ip + port to definition so everything is on one place

     int publish (topic, payload) {const char[]; const char[]}
     int publish (topic, payload, length) {const char[]; byte[]; byte}
     int publish (topic, payload, retained) {const char[]; const char[]; bool}

     MAYBE TODO
     - implement MQTT disconnect so we dont generate

     To get TinyGPS++ to work, you have to repeatedly funnel the characters to it from the GPS module using the encode() method.

DEBUG:
     possible issue 1 :
     if root topic or device name is changed it might cause overflow
     check size of before defining final MQTT topic PATHS
     - maybe define whole topic path and then measure its size
